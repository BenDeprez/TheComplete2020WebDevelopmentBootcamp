# Git, Github and Version Control  

## Local repositories  

Initialize git  
`git init`  

Examine staging area (untracked files in red)  
`git status`  

Add file to staging area  
`git add <filename>`  

Add all to staging area  
`git add .`  

Remove file from staging area  
`git rm --cached <filename>`  

Commit file from staging area to local repository. Convention states that commit messages are written in present tense.  
`git commit -m "commit message"`  

Examine commit history  
`git log`  

Examine differences between versions  
`git diff <filename>`  

## Branching and merging  

creating local branch  
`git branch <branchname>`  

Examine branches  
`git branch`  

Branch && checkout  
`git checkout -b <branchname>`  

Merge onto master  
`git checkout master && git merge <branchname>`  

Rebase branch onto master  
`git rebase master <branchname>`  

## Moving around in git  

HEAD is the symbolic name for the currently checked out commit -- it's essentially what commit you're working on top of.  

### Detaching head  

Detaching HEAD just means attaching it to a commit instead of a branch. This is done by checking out the commit hash.  

HEAD -> master -> C1  
`git checkout C1`  
HEAD -> C1  

## Relative refs ( ^ moving HEAD relative to <name> )  

parent of master  
`master^`  

grandparent of master  
`master^^`  

reference HEAD (move up one)  
`git checkout HEAD^`  

## Relative refs 2 ( ~n moving up several levels )  

ascend 4 levels  
`git checkout HEAD~4`

## Branch forcing  

forcefully move master branch to 3 parents behind HEAD  
`git branch -f master HEAD~3`  

## Reversing Changes ( reset / revert )  

Reset steps back in time  
C1 -> C2 -> C1  

revert creates a new commit that exactly reverses the previous commit  
C1 -> C2 -> C2'  

## Moving work around  

### git cherry-pick  

With the master branch checked out, cherry pick commits from side branch  
`git cherry-pick c2 c4`  
some commit (master*) -> c2' -> c4' (master*)  

## Interactive rebasing ( interactive = -i )  

Opens a UI which allows for the reordering and omitting of commits  
`git rebase -i HEAD~3`  

## Juggling commits ( rebase )  

- change commit order  
- amend commit  
- change commit order back  
- checkout and move master

`git rebase -i`  
`git commit --amend`  
`git rebase -i`  
`git checkout master`  
`git branch -f master HEAD`  

A lot of reordering can introduce rebase conflicts  

## Juggling commits 2 ( cherry-pick )  

`git checkout master`  
`git cherry-pick C2`  
`git commit --amend`  
`git cherry-pick C3`  

## Tags  

You can checkout a tag, tags mark milestones  
`git tag v1 C2`  

## git describe  

`git describe <ref>`  

output => `<tag>_<numCommits>_g<hash>`

`tag`: nearest tag near current  
`numCommits`: nÂ° of commits nearest tag is removed from current  
`hash`: hash of current  

## Specifying parents

`git checkout master` => C1  
`git checkout master^2` => C2

create bugWork branch on location relative to master* (1 up, second branch, 1 up)
`git branch bugWork master~^2~`

## Remote repositories  

Create repository on Github  
Then add remote to local repository.  
`git remote add origin <url.git>`  

Push local repository to remote repository. The -u option links up the local and remote, origin is name of remote, master is name of branch.  
`git remote -u origin master`  

create local copy of remote repo  
`git clone`  
creates a new branch in the local repo called: origin/master  

download data from remote  
`git fetch`  

Once you have new commits available locally, you can incorporate them as if they were just normal commits on other branches, using cherry-pick, rebase, merge, etc...    
download and merge data from remote
`git pull` = `git fetch && git merge origin/master`
